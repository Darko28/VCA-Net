This is only a preliminary research and shall be updated as my research goes on.

I have read plenty of papers but still am not convinced that this is a meaningful research regarding actual stroke imaging use cases. 
Even though with a prototype stroke imaging application is developed. 
At least it is not when I mentioned this research with my mentor, who is a world-wide specialist in Stroke and Imaging.

Deep learning based models (to MRI/CT images) could lead to some good results, but lack of interpretability and are not that useful comparing to other imaging techniques.


Some of the codes are borrowed from other repositories. Thanks to all of them. (I shall already cite their papers, but do let me know if I left out someone's work:)).


However, please consider to cite this paper if any idea or code is helpful, and welcome to reach out to me as I am still new to this field:).


Note:
    
    I will update with a better model, and it seems Dice Loss should be sufficient enough for this model, and the BCELoss is redundant; I will find time to retrain and validate this issue.
